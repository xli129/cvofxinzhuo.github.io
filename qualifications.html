				<ul>
					<li><b>Introduction to Computer Programming:</b> Fundamentals of computer programming using the Python language.</li>
					<li><b>Introduction to Computer Science:</b> An introduction to Computer Science, including algorithms, computability, complexity and object-oriented programming.</li>
					<li><b>Computer Systems:</b> An introductory course to computer systems and is a mixture of computer programming in C, computer architecture, and embedded systems.</li>
					<li><b>Formal Languages and Compilers:</b>This course deals with fundamental concepts and techniques in computer science. It covers automata, formal languages, compilers, computability and complexity theory.</li>
					<li><b>Introduction to Computer Networks and the Internet:</b> Principles of theory and practice of computer networks and the Internet, and it studies important Internet technologies and protocols, including: Ethernet / Local Area Networks, TCP/IP, Routing, and HTTP.</li>
					<li><b>Data and Network Security:</b> Principles and practice of security for both stored and transmitted information. It addresses the fundamental principles of computer and network security.</li>
					<li><b>Computer Graphics:</b> The course focuses on all aspects of fundamental computer graphics, including 2D/3D object representations, transformations, modelling and rendering algorithms. The course also aims to provide a good foundation for OpenGL programming, which is a widely accepted standard for developing graphics applications.</li>
					<li><b>Internet Technology and Engineering:</b> This course covers theory and practice of Internet routing and the application of mathematical optimization to network and capacity planning problems.</li>
					<li><b>Artificial Intelligence: </b> This course introduces important concepts in computational intelligence and demonstrates how they are used to solve problems that are normally difficult or intractable by conventional means. Topics covered include algorithms, techniques, and languages commonly used in artificial intelligence, knowledge representations and reasoning, and bio-inspired computing.</li>
					<li><b>Humans and Computers:</b> The course provides an introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). HCI is concerned with understanding, designing, implementing and evaluating user-interfaces so that they better support users in carrying out their tasks. On completing the course you will have knowledge of the theoretical foundations of designing for interaction between humans and computers. You will also have practical experience in implementing and evaluating graphical user interfaces.</li>
